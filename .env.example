# Hashnode API Key (optional but recommended)
# Get your API key from: https://hashnode.com/settings/developer
# 
# With API key: Tags show as readable names (e.g., "JavaScript", "React", "Next.js")
# Without API key: Tags show as IDs (e.g., "Tag-6547328", "Tag-abc123") 
#
# The converter works fine without this, but enriched data provides much better
# tag names and series information for your Obsidian vault.
#
# Example:
# HASHNODE_API_KEY=abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901vwx234yz
HASHNODE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
